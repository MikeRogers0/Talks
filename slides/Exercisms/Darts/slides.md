# Exercism: Darts

By @MikeRogers0

---
<!-- _class: lead -->
<!--
This is the main bit of the task which jumped out to me.

Especially the word "Cartesian (Car-tea-shin) Coordinates". I think that was keyword hint, but I kind of ignored it.

-->

# What are we trying to solve?

> Write a method that, given a point in the target (defined by its real _Cartesian coordinates_ x and y), returns the correct amount earned by a dart landing in that point.

---
<!--
So what are we trying to do?

We're going to be given coordinates, we need to return a score.
-->

# What are we trying to solve?

- We're going to be given a set of coordinates
- We have to return the score based on how close that is to the target (`0,0`)
  - outside the target: 0 points.
  - in the outer circle of the target: 1 point.
  - in the middle circle of the target: 5 points.
  - in the inner circle of the target: 10 points.

---
<!--

I thought the best place to start would be by getting the correct score given just one coordinate. 

So I just passed in X, looped though the radius-to-score mapping returning the source.
-->

# Let's start with the x coordinate

```ruby
class Darts
  RADIUS_SCORE_MAP = { 1 => 10, 5 => 5, 10 => 1 }

  def initialize(x)
    @x = x.to_i
  end

  def score
    RADIUS_SCORE_MAP.each do |radius, map_score|
      return map_score if radius >= @x
    end
    0
  end
end
```

---
<!--
That actually worked out ok.

I thought I was on the right track to solving this.
-->

# Let's start with the x coordinate

```ruby
Darts.new(0).score # Returns 10
Darts.new(2).score # Returns 5
Darts.new(9).score # Returns 1
Darts.new(11).score # Returns 0
```

---
<!--
So I thought the right way I could get the correct was to just to pick the biggest of X & Y, then get the score from that.

I messed about with a few coordinates like:

x = 9, y = 0
x = 1, y = 1
&
x = 0, y = 2

It look like it was working. I was feeling pretty good.
-->

# Awesome now both coordinates

What if I used the biggest of the two coordinates?


```ruby {6}
class Darts
  def initialize(x, y)
  # [..]

  def score
    RADIUS_SCORE_MAP.each do |radius, map_score|
      return map_score if radius >= [@x, @y].max
    end
    0
  end
end
```

---
<!--
Spoiler: That was not the right solution.

I then came back the term:
"Cartesian (Car-tea-shin) Coordinates"

I searched on Wikipedia, ended up on a page with diagram of a circle.

Then I realised my mistake, and I drew it onto a graph to emphasise it a bit better.

If we look at 9,-9.
My "take the biggest coordinates" approach wasn't so full proof. Obviously it would have worked if these were squares.

What we need to do is figure is if the point is within one of the circles.

This distance, the black line

Luckily we know the distance these two lines, which gives us something which looks
suspiciously like a triangle.

<!--
We need to use Pythagorean theorem!

<!-- _class: lead -->

# Pythagorean theorem

a<sup>2</sup> + b<sup>2</sup> = c<sup>2</sup>

I did have to search how to do "To the power of" & "Square root" in ruby.

While searching Stackoverflow, I found:
-->

# Pythagorean theorem

```ruby
class Darts
  # [..]

  def hypotenuse
    Math.sqrt(@x**2 + @y**2)
  end
end

Darts.new(0, 10).hypotenuse # 10.0
Darts.new(-5, 0).hypotenuse # 5.0
Darts.new(9, -9).hypotenuse # 12.727922061357855
```

---
<!--
I found out yesterday, there is actually a Math.hypot method to do this!
-->

# Pythagorean theorem

```ruby
class Darts
  # [..]

  def hypotenuse
    Math.hypot(@x, @y)
  end
end

Darts.new(0, 10).hypotenuse # 10.0
Darts.new(-5, 0).hypotenuse # 5.0
Darts.new(9, -9).hypotenuse # 12.727922061357855
```

<!--
My full code looked a bit like:

- I'm not fan about how I'm just setting x & z in the initialize

- I don't really like how I calculated the score, or the "hypotenuse_score_map" variable naming.

-- If I was to add a new score circle in & put it in the wrong place, it would probably break.

-->

```ruby
class Darts
  HYPOTENUSE_SCORE_MAP = { 1 => 10, 5 => 5, 10 => 1 }

  def initialize(x, y)
    @x = x
    @y = y
  end

  def score
    HYPOTENUSE_SCORE_MAP
      .select { |radius, _map_score| radius >= hypotenuse }
      .values
      .first || 0
  end

  private

  def hypotenuse
    Math.hypot(@x, @y)
  end
end

```

---

<!--
However! The tests were passing, so I was happy enough to submit it.

I did run the tests a bunch & look what happens if I was to calculate the hypotenuse in the initialize, but that ended up being an exceptionally tiny difference.
-->

# All the tests pass

$ ruby darts_test.rb
